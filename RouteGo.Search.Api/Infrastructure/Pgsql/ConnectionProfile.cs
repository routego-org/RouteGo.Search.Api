// The connection-string profile for the Lambda execution model this process runs on
// (references/connection-resilience.md, "Two profiles"). The pool stays ON for both models;
// what differs is its size, whether keepalives can do any good, and whether a dropped
// connection should also clear the rest of the idle pool.
//
//   Lambda            — one invocation per process, frozen between invocations. The pool's timers
//                       do not tick while frozen, so keepalives are pointless; a handler's opens
//                       are sequential, so the pool stays small; after a freeze the whole idle
//                       pool is dead, so the writer clears it on a transient failure.
//   ManagedInstances  — many concurrent invocations in one always-on process (as is a local
//                       Kestrel run). The timers tick, so a keepalive under the 350 s idle timeout
//                       of the Lambda-to-VPC network hop keeps sockets alive; the pool is sized to
//                       the concurrency; clearing it would evict sockets other requests are using.
//
// Chosen from the deployment template's DB_CONNECTION_PROFILE / DB_MAX_POOL_SIZE (ConfigKeys —
// wire_database.py adds the two constants and their local values), never sniffed from the runtime,
// so the difference between the two models is one reviewed line in the template.
// Never add No Reset On Close=true here: DISCARD ALL on return to the pool is the second net
// under the audit trigger's SET LOCAL identity.
