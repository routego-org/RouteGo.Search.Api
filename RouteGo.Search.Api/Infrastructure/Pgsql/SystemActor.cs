// The actor for work that has no request: schedulers, queue consumers, EventBridge
// targets, replay jobs. A worker host registers this as ICurrentActor; a web host never
// does — HttpContextActor refuses to write without a principal rather than borrowing
// this identity (see its header), because a "system" stamp on a write that escaped its
// request is a forged audit row, not a fallback.
//
// A web host that ALSO runs hosted background work gives that work its own writer factory
// built over a SystemActor instance, rather than swapping the request-scoped registration:
//   var jobsWriter = new WriterConnectionFactory(connectionString, SystemActor.Default, retryOptions);
// Pair the write with a "job:" action (references/audit.md, action vocabulary) so scheduler
// traffic stays trivially separable from user actions in audit.change_log.
//
// Register in a worker:
//   services.AddSingleton<ICurrentActor>(SystemActor.Default);
// Singleton is correct here — it holds no request state, so scope validation (non-negotiable
// #26) has nothing to object to.
//
// RouteGo.Search.Api.Common.Ports comes from GlobalUsings.cs (copy-assets.ps1 adds it); a local using is a red build (IDE0005).
