// Dapper's two deliberate globals, applied in code, once, before the first query.
// Everything else on Dapper's settings surface stays at its default, and what people
// usually reach for here (retry, logging, buffering) has another home -- see the
// "Dapper global settings" section of the Postgres skill's schema-conventions reference.
//
// Copy with scripts/copy-assets.ps1; verify wiring with scripts/check_dapper_mapping.py.
// No `using Dapper;` here: copy-assets.ps1 puts `global using Dapper;` in the project's
// GlobalUsings.cs, and the build-enforced coding standard makes a duplicate a red build (IDE0005).
