// user-secrets, every other environment reads Secrets Manager
// (skills-aspnetcore-project-setup/references/secrets.md).

// Copy with scripts/copy-assets.ps1, which stamps both the root namespace (RouteGo.Search.Api) and the app slug
// (route-go-search-api) from -Name; pass -SecretSlug when the deployed secret is spelled differently. Secrets
// Manager accepts both - and _, so a project can legitimately be on either -- what must never vary
// is this app's own name across its accounts. ONE name is resolved, never two: trying a second
// spelling at runtime is the fallback that let a laptop and a deployed host take different paths.
