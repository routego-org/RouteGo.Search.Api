// Drop-in adapter for IWriterConnectionFactory (Common/Ports): opens a
// request-scoped transaction and stamps the actor identity AND the business
// action as SET LOCAL GUCs — with bounded, transient-only retry around that open.
//
// The actor (app.actor_*) is AMBIENT — sourced from the authenticated session, so
// the factory sets it automatically. The action (app.action) is SEMANTIC — only the
// calling code knows whether this transaction is "CreateOrder" or "RefundPayment" —
// so the caller MUST pass it to OpenWriteTransactionAsync(action, ...). It cannot be derived.
//
// This is the write path (see references/patterns.md). Reads use a plain connection from
// IReaderConnectionFactory; every WRITE MUST go through a connection obtained here — the
// audit trigger RAISE EXCEPTIONs if the app.actor_* OR app.action GUCs are not set.
//
// Retry (references/connection-resilience.md). A pooled socket that died while the process
// was frozen fails on the FIRST bytes written — here, BEGIN + set_config — before any business
// statement. So the retry lives entirely inside this method, needs no delegate, and is
// pre-commit by construction: nothing has been stamped or written when it fires. It is
// transient-only (a constraint violation, RAISE or check failure is deterministic and never
// retried), bounded (1 + 2), jittered and sub-second, and honours the caller's
// CancellationToken. Whether a failure also evicts the rest of the idle pool is the one
// runtime-dependent choice, carried by ConnectionRetryOptions.
//
// Identity never touches process state. It has exactly two homes — the request's async
// context (the actor, read lazily inside this method) and the open transaction (SET LOCAL,
// gone at COMMIT/ROLLBACK). A pooled physical connection carries nothing from one borrower
// to the next; Npgsql's DISCARD ALL on return is the second net (never set
// No Reset On Close=true). That is what makes one code path safe on default Lambda and on
// Managed Instances alike.
//
// Pin the writer to the primary in its connection string — Target Session Attributes=read-write —
// so that after a failover the write fails at connect with a clear message instead of
// 25006 "cannot execute INSERT in a read-only transaction" from the middle of a handler.
//
// Tenancy note: app.tenant_id is intentionally NOT set here. The tenancy skill layers a
// variant of this factory that also stamps app.tenant_id. In single-tenant apps the audit
// trigger reads it defensively as null. If tenancy is enforced by row-level security, the
// READ path needs that GUC as well — a policy evaluating an unset GUC returns zero rows,
// quietly — so the tenancy skill layers the reader too; "reads carry no GUCs" has exactly
// that one exception.
//
// Register (see also ReaderConnectionFactory.cs, ActorClaimOptions.cs, HttpContextActor.cs,
// ConnectionRetryOptions.cs, SystemActor.cs; resolving the connection strings — IConfiguration /
// SSM / Secrets Manager — is the composition root's per-host concern, and so is choosing the
// retry profile from a deployment-time signal your IaC sets per function):

//       // freezes the first invocation's actor for the life of the process — every later
//       // user's writes stamped with someone else's identity. CreateBuilder turns these on
//       // in Development only; a laptop throws, production forges audit rows.
