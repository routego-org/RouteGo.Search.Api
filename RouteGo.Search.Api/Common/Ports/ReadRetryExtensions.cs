// Bounded, transient-only retry for the read path (references/connection-resilience.md).
//
// The reader's first statement is the caller's own SELECT, so a dead pooled socket (a
// process that was frozen while the far end dropped the connection) surfaces inside the
// query, not inside the factory. This wraps the whole read — open, query, dispose — and
// re-runs it on a fresh connection when the failure is a transport one. A read is
// idempotent by definition, so the whole unit is always safe to redo.
//
// Pure System.Data.Common: DbException.IsTransient is what Npgsql overrides for the
// stale-socket shape, so this needs no driver reference and Common/Ports/ stays clean for
// the host's architecture test ("nothing outside Infrastructure references the DB driver").
// The one thing it cannot do without the driver is evict the rest of the idle pool; the
// writer factory owns that (ConnectionRetryOptions), and on the single-invocation runtime a
// pool of two to four makes a second dead draw rare.
//
// The four guardrails, all required: transient-only; 1 try + 2 retries; a jittered
// sub-second delay; the caller's CancellationToken honoured in the condition and the delay.
//
// Usage from a slice:
//   IEnumerable<OrderSummary> rows = await _readerFactory.ExecuteReadAsync(
//       conn => conn.QueryAsync<OrderSummary>(new CommandDefinition(sql, args, cancellationToken: ct)), ct);
//
// No `using System.Data.Common;` here: copy-assets.ps1 puts it in the project's GlobalUsings.cs,
// and the build-enforced coding standard makes a duplicate a red build (IDE0005).
