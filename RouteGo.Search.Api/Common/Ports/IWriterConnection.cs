// The unit of work handed out by IWriterConnectionFactory. Exposes the abstract
// System.Data.Common types so Common/Ports/ carries no database driver; the
// Infrastructure adapter backs them with Npgsql.
//
// No `using System.Data.Common;` here: copy-assets.ps1 puts it in the project's GlobalUsings.cs,
// and the build-enforced coding standard makes a duplicate a red build (IDE0005).
