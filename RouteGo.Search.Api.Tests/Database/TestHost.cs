// Adapts the stamped ApiFactory to the database fixture. The factory is generic on purpose — it
// injects "a secret, by name" and knows nothing about Postgres
// (skills-aspnetcore-project-setup/references/test-host.md) — so joining it to this app's database
// secret is the database skill's few lines, beside the fixture. The secret is injected as an
// environment variable inside the factory, which is process-global: every host in a run must get
// the same database, and sharing DatabaseCollection's one fixture is what guarantees that.
//
// Ships from skills-db-postgres (assets/Tests/Database/) into the api stack only — the lambda
// worker has no host factory to adapt. Never hand-edited: an app that needs a fake beside the
// database passes it through `overrides`.
