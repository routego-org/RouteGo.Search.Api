/// 1. <c>UseEnvironment(Environments.Development)</c>. The secret gate is
/// <c>IHostEnvironment.IsDevelopment()</c>. A host that does not say so runs as <b>Production</b>
/// and SecretResolver takes the Secrets Manager path — from CI, with no role
/// (references/secrets.md).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// 2. The secret is injected as an <b>environment variable</b>, never through <c>UseSetting</c> or
/// <c>ConfigureAppConfiguration</c>. <c>WebApplication.CreateBuilder</c> re-applies its own sources
/// — user-secrets included — on top of anything a test appends, and a developer's user-secrets
/// mirror this very name. The environment-variable provider is registered AFTER user-secrets, so
/// it is the one source that deterministically wins.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <c>Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable</c> is process-global. Every factory in a run that injects
